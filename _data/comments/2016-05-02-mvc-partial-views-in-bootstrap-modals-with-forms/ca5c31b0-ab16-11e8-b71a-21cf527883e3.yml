  So using this method works except if I need the user to be able to open the
  modal a 2nd time on the page after posting. The 2nd time the user clicks the
  button that launches the modal it goes dark but doesn't open a window because
  the modal's content has been replaced by the "closeModal" content. How would I
  refill the modal with the form's content after the closeModal executes.
